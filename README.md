# my-haxe-libraries
my haXe code libraries,  
mainly reusable code that comes from making games with Heaps.io  

if you came for HeapsPunk, it move to [it's own hp repo](https://github.com/rahil627/hp)

note: the repo name is short because it is also the package name, which matches the folder name, and it makes it convenient to clone and use as a git submodule, without adding another folder
