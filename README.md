# my-haxe-libraries
my haXe code libraries,  
mainly reusable code that comes from making games with Heaps.io  

hp = HeapsPunk!

note: the repo name is short because it is also the package name,  
which matches the folder name,  
and it makes it convenient to clone and use as a git submodule,  
without adding another folder  
..it seems people throw external libs in a 'net' folder anyway...
