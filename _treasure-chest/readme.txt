this folder is just a treasure chest to quickly grab shit from as i need them
think of it as a useful junk bin that you go to when you need to make something :)

TODO: learn how licenses work


NOTE: Heaps has nearly everything, just have to search for it, just use github to search the repo

need:
gamepad input
  - hxd.Pad
  - simple one from tefvel
  - complex one from deepnight
  
touch input
  - including multi-touch


want:
entity container ds
  - **EntityList from HaxePunk**
    - uses array and features "object pooling"!!

simpler input management (mouse, touch, key: all together?)
  - Mouse from terryheaps
    - **use this as a base**
    
sound helper
  - simple one from terryheaps
    - **use this as a base, also see ld40**
  - complex one already exists in Heaps (snd.Manager)
  
geometry / 2d math
  - **hxd.h2d.col**
    - Heaps already provides most of the geometry classes; note: Bounds = rectangle
  - classes
    - Vector2d
      - HaxePunk
      - or use Heaps.Vector (4d) as a base  

**vector graphics drawing functions**
  - ?

color
  - check what heaps has
  - deepnight has a good one
  - there are many others out there too
      
tweens
  - **does heaps even have any?? :o**
  - TODO: get haxepunk/tweens, especially motion tweens
