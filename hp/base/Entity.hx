	// inheritance vs composition?
	// http://entity-systems.wikidot.com/ says composition > inheritance
	// with composition, you can select which features you want to glue together, which makes everything re-usable
	// with inheritance, it becomes difficult to select certain features without inheriting extra crap
	// even the transform part (Object) should be optional, so that you can have an entity for just game logic
	
	// components?
	// https://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/component.html
	// setting up entity to use a component design might be fine for an engine with a game editor
	// but doing it through code seems pretty excessive:
	// for every entity you'd have multiple individualized component classes
	// i personally like this simple composition style better
	
	// "components" that come in Heaps 2d module
	// Object = transform, scene tree container
	// Layers = Object + scene tree container helper functions to order contained Objects for drawing
	// Drawable = Object + draw/render
	// Anim = Object + draw/render + animation-related functions
	// Graphics = Object + draw/render + helper graphics drawling library
	
	// maybe can create getter/setter to work with Layers	?
	// unimpl: associating a 1:1 relationship to layer would create a limit:
	// all of the Objects within entity would be expected to have the same layer
	// imagine a sprite class in one later, and it's particle effects on another layer
	//var layer(get, set):Layer; // layer = Layer enum value = used as index in Layers
	//var positionWithinLayer(get, set):Int; // optionally used in layers for positioning within a layer
	// also can provide a few helper functions like Layer.under/over for moveToTopOfLayer/moveToBottomOfLayer
	
	//var id:Int; // maybe useful for finding it later..?, can be used as a map key, TODO: storing temp int vs reference?
	//var name:String; // although strange, i've seen HaxePunk and Armory use this for searching, secret optimization magic??
	//var kind:EntityKind; // maybe useful narrowing down searches; one big container vs keeping multiple containers
	//var class = Type.getClassName(Type.getClass(this)); // @author MikeTuttle/HaxePunk, i think it uses reflection, which might not be good for cross-platform use

	// note:
	// HaxePunk's Entity is massive class containing a *ton* of helper collision functions like
	// CollidesWith(Entity, Type, Class, Point, Rect, etc.)
	// but i don't think i'll abstract collision from Object (...i'm not even sure if there is any in there!!),
	// i'd rather just stick to using core Heaps, than to create a giant framework
	// you'd have to do something like entity.spriteObject.getBounds().intersects/contains(anotherObject.getBounds())...	
	// from the sample: https://github.com/HeapsIO/heaps/blob/master/samples/CollideCheck.hx
	// it's just a matter of creating a new Colliders every frame and using some function (inside..) woww!! so simple!! :D :D
	// ...i think HaxePunk's entity class had a hitbox/collision-mask... so, maybe you can add a collider to entity, if you want..
	// but the only common function the colliders have is contain() (found in the ICollider interface)
	// so you might be able to do entity.collider.contains(entity.collider)? I dunno...
	// anyway, i'd rather not couple collision with entity, for now..
