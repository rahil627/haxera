HeapsPunk!!!

okay okay, it won't ever live up to that name... but.. you know.. inspired by it! :)


Heaps seems to be, in my opinion, the successor of the Punks: FlashPunk by Chevy Ray Johnston, and HaxePunk by MikeTuttle (even the Haxe language itself, feels like an ancestor of ActionScript!). Heaps has nearly all of the functionality of the Punk engines. The problem for me, however, is that unlike the Punk engines, that functionality feels hidden, hidden
