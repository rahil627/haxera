todo: add to haxe.txt

just a temp place to leave some notes i get from the web with my iPad
or from vim/server



if the module/package doesn't match the file-path
  - add "-cp path-to-modules" to hxml file

 // this.super() doesn't work, must use just super()

import ra.hp.* // doesn't work recursively...

//this = null; // TODO: FAIL, lol    

// note: classes have new instead of class name / standard constructor

// TODO: init in constuctor vs in init()
hmm, why ever seperate this?


naming:
classes at least two characters so that refactoring isn't bad, and that ctags 'n autocomplete all work okay
PunkApp extends App


std.Int() // no (Int)floatyNumber


// TODO: haxe.std not showing up in autocompletion...
