todo: copy to my dropbox

can put notes i gather from the web on my iPad more easily here,
just use the web interface from github


heaps structure:

file / package stucture:
h2d
h3d
hxd
top-level

class / data stucture:

window, scene, app:
Window[.js/hl/.etc]
  - maybe a high-level abstraction of the OS window (SDL)
  - there's a different Window for every target
  - contains a single static instance of itself: Window.getInstance()
  - generally don't need to touch this, as Scene handles 'n abstracts most of it (??)
  - might be able to edit some vars through the hxml file: for example, Window.title
  - from FP/HXP, this is HXP.Window
  - from Godot/Unity, this is where you check-mark full-screen, borderless, etc. (DisplayMode)
Scene
  - extends Layers, InteractableScene (TODO: still learning..)
  - edits the Window for different ScaleMode
  - draws the entire scene tree front-to-back via drawContent
  - handles Layers (TODO: but maybe just used internally(??), along with camera(?))
  - handles changing Scene
  - from FP/HXP, maybe a combo of HXP.scene, HXP.screen (ScaleMode, mouse/touch input), and FP/HXP.world? (not sure...)
App
  - designed to be inherited, providing entry to the main init() and main update()
  - contains a single static instance of itself (can store a reference of it yourself)
  - has the first default instance of Scene (s2d/s3d)
  - has the main game loop (it's internal, no need to touch)
  - initalizes Key
  - from FP/HXP, this is HXP.Engine
Key
  - a static helper class for key inputs
  - from FP/HXP, this is also Key!

input flow / propogation:
  - input events are setup in Window via addEventListener, accordingly to each target
    - then handled by Scene
    - then further simplified and handled by Key
    - ...then optionally accessed by Interactable?
  - although you can access all of the global input events, you will likely want to use Key for keys and Interactable for mouse/input
  - can use Interactable to handle mouse/touch input events and
  - can use Key to handle keyboard events from anywhere, even without Interactable!
  - Interactable provides a link between scene tree objects and input, figuring out which object should receive the input
    - imagine you have a 3d world on a tablet device, you will likely want the top-most objects to capture input
  - Scene has getInteractable (among other things...) which figures out and fetches the top-most Interactable

object, and all of it's inherited classes:
  - think of these as components of an entity: transform, render, input, vector graphics, etc.
    - as in, something that provides a suite of vars 'n functions to help do something in particular: a library?
  - maybe can inherit Object to write your own component (?)
Object
  - base scene tree object
  - can have a parent Object and can have children Objects, like Flash api
  - provides a transform component (x, y, rotation), providing local to global coordinate helper functions too
Drawable
  - extends Object
  - ...provides a draw/render component (?? no clue)
Graphics
  - extends Drawable
  - provides a Flash-like vector drawing api component (lineStyle, moveTo/lineTo, fill/endFill, etc.)
Interactable
  - extends Object
  - provides an input capture handling component
Layers
  - extends Object
  - ...?? provides a special container data structure tailored to the scene tree: the 2d array of the scene tree
  - it provides ways to put/remove things where you want in the scene tree: under this object, above that layer, etc.,
