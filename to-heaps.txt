todo: copy to my dropbox

can put notes i gather from the web on my iPad more easily here,
just use the web interface from github


heaps structure:

file / package stucture:
h2d
h3d
hxd
top-level

class / data stucture:
Window[.js/hl/.etc]
  - maybe a high-level abstraction of window in SDL
  - a seperate Window for every platform
  - generally don't need to touch this, as Scene handles 'n abstracts most of it
Scene
  - edits the window
  - extends Layers, InteractableScene (TODO: still learning..)
  - draws the entire scene tree front-to-back via drawContent
App
  - has a scene
  - has the main game loop
  - initalizes Key

Key
 - a static helper class for key inputs

input events are setup in Window via addEventListener, depending on the platform
then handled by scene
in general, should use Interactable class to handle input events
Scene has getInteractable which will get the top-most Interactable,
like a scene tree, but for inputs


Object
  - base scene tree object
  - can have a parent Object and can have children Objects
  - has a transform (x, y, rotation), local and global coordinates can be fetched
Drawable extends Object (TODO: still learning...)
Graphics extends Drawable
  - has Flash-like api for drawing things to the screen (lineStyle, moveTo/lineTo, fill/endFill, etc.)
